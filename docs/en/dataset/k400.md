Kinetics is released by DeepMind, which is a collection of large-scale,   
high-quality datasets of URL links of up to 650,000 video clips that   
cover 400/600/700 human action classes, depending on the dataset version，  
here we use Kinetics400. The data format is video,e.g. mp4, which can be   
used directly. We alse decode all videos to frames before model training,   
which will significantly improve model training efficiency. PaddleVideo   
have released the decode tool, and support both video and frames input   
for model training and testing.

download  
You can Download Kinetics400  from ActivityNet’s offical page repo .  
You can alse download kinetics400 from SkyDrive cloud(TODO).

Video decode  
You can decode videos to frames using extract_rawframes.py

Useage ：  
python3 extract_rawframes.py  video_path   frames_path  --level 2 --ext mp4 
where，  
video_path is the video dir to be decoded，in which is action_name/video_name 2-level dir structure.   
frames_path is the frames dir instored after decoding，in which is action_name/video_name/frames 3-level dir structure.
