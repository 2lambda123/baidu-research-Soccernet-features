Based on paddle2.0, we improved TSM，almost not increase the number of model parameters and FLOPs,  
to achieve the goal of improving the accuracy of detector as much as possible  
while ensuring that the speed is almost unchanged.  

By combining multiple tricks, PP-TSM can achieve a better balance between effectiveness (73.5% Top1)  
and efficiency (TODO), surpassing the existing 2D video models’s accuracy such as TSN and TSM  
in multiple datasets such as UCF101、Kinetics-400。  

For detail, refer to the page of high-level tutorial(TODO).
