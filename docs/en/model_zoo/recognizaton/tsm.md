TSM is Temporal Shift Module for Efficient Video Understanding, which is Accepted by ICCV 2019.   
TSM enjoys both high efficiency and high performance.  
Specifically, it can achieve the performance of 3D CNN but maintain 2D CNN's complexity.  
For detail , refer to the paper Temporal Shift Module for Efficient Video Understanding.
